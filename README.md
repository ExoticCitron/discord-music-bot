# Spotify Discord
Made this for my server, but you can use it too ig lmao
Uses spotipy library to fetch spotify track/album info and uses ytdlp to extract audio and stream it directly through discord 

# Get started
> 1) Download FFMPEG
> This is a required prerequisite (all credits to [@DanielOrourke02](https://github.com/DanielOrourke02) for bringing this up and suggesting a resolve - woulda forgot). Using this because it supports far more formats and is better in quality. Check the link to see how to get started with FFMPEG:  https://transloadit.com/devtips/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-a-complete-guide/

> 2) Download dependencies:
> **Unless you're a complete idiot, this should be easy..**
```python
pip install discord
pip install spotipy
pip install yt-dlp
```

> 3) Get spotify API scopes:
> Scopes needed: `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` [in cogs/music.py] - these can be obtained [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)

> 4) Start your bot:
> Add your bot token and start it, this required slash commands

I'll be regularly updating this, current version v1.1, v1.2 will be pushed soon, request fixes/features on pull req and i'll update this with features by the 10th
